<h1>Welcome!</h1>	       
<p>Welcome to my personal website!</p><img class="float-right half-img polaroid" src="img/personalInformation.jpg"/>
<p>My name is Florencia Pereira, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porte%C3%B1o">porte√±a</a> by birth and by choice. I am a Computer Engineer, graduated from <a href="">Buenos Aires University (UBA)</a>. I work mainly as a Developer.</p>
<p>mflorenciapereira.com.ar was thought as a way of sharing my experience and skills regarding information technology as well as a place to organize resources for 
my passions and hobbies.</p>
<p>I am a Technology enthusiast, I love discovering and testing new frameworks in any programming language and putting them in practice to 
solve people needs. 
I  vary as much as I can the frameworks I use from project to project, so that I can discover and learn new tools in the process of development. 
Most of the projects I have worked with can be found in the <a href="#portfolio">Porfolio</a> section. 
There you will find a detailed description of the architecture, implementation and repositories for open source projects I have been working on. </p>
<p>Another aspect of Information Tehnology I am really into is Information Security. As you can see in my Resume, I am doing a Master's degree in the area. You can find 
articles on the subject in the Blog section. </p>
<p>I have plenty of hobbies. I recently discovered my love for cooking and I found the Blog section a good place to store some of the recipes I want to have at hand. Apart from that, I do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_cycling">spinning</a> about three times a week, as well as swimming.
I wish I had more time for travelling. About two years ago I visited London and fell in love with the city. I had the opportunity to visit Liverpool, too, which made my holidays unforgettable since I am really fond of The Beatles.
More recently, I spent my holidays in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariloche">Bariloche</a> (that's where I took the photo on the right), a beautiful city in Patagonia. Photos and informations regarding my trips can also be found in the Blog section.
 </p>
 <p> Finally, mflorenciapereira.com.ar has a Contact me section where you can send me a message and ways to connect with me on social networks.
 Have fun!
