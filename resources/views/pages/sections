<p>Welcome to my personal website!</p>
<p>My name is Florencia Pereira, a <a href="">porte√±a</a> by birth and by choice. I am a Computer Engineer, graduated from <a href="">Buenos Aires University (UBA)</a>. I work mainly as a Developer.</p>
<p>mflorenciapereira.com.ar was thought as a way of sharing my experience and skills regarding information technology as well as a place to organize resources for 
my passions and hobbies.</p>
I am a Technology enthusiast, I love discovering and testing new frameworks in any programming language and putting them in practice to 
solve people needs. 
I try to vary as much as I can the frameworks I use from project to project, so that I can discover and learn new tools in the process of development. 
Most of the projects I have worked with can be found in the Porfolio section. 
There you will find a detailed description of the architecture, implementation and repositories for open source projects I have been working on. 
Amongst others, ing PHP, Java, Ruby, Hibernate, Jquery, Node JS, Angulat JS, Codeigniter, Laravel, Rails, Android amongst others.
Another aspect of Information Tehnology I am really into is Information Security.
